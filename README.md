# [Background Blender](https://react-background-blender.netlify.app)

**Background Blender** is a background blend mode sandbox. It pulls random photos from the [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) API and blends them with a specified color. Users can choose which background blend mode to apply to the photo.

## Background:

This project is a React conversion of a project I originally created in vanilla JS. The original repo can be viewed [here](https://github.com/aemann2/background-blender)

I've always thought `background blend mode` was one of CSS's cooler features, so I decided to base a project around it. I wanted this one to be a basic API project with a little DOM manipulation that utilizes live CSS variables to adjust colors on the page. I decided in **Figma** to make the design as minimal as possible, and to focus on responsiveness and a smooth UI. This was a fun little project and I'm happy with the way it turned out.

## Technology:

HTML / SASS, React, Figma, Lorem Picsum API

## What I learned or used for the first time:

- **CSS Variables**
- **React hooks**
- **Lifting up state in React**
- **How to create user stories to organize tasks**
- **Creating branches at the beginning of the project and merging them with PRs once work was completed**
- **A custom-styled HTML select box**
